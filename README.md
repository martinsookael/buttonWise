ButtonWise
===================

A hackatlon project to create animation similar to this:  
![Original image](https://raw.github.com/martinsookael/buttonWise/master/public/images/oringial_animation.gif)

In case it's not clear, on click:  
1. A little droplet starts from the middle of the button.  
2. If it reaches the borders of the button, then  
3. The original button starts to rotate and  
4. The droplet keeps going over the button borders  
5. The "..." turns smaller and dissolves while  
6. A wild "+" appears.  
7. At the same time 3 icons appear inside the wave and  
8. The wave flows a little step back.
